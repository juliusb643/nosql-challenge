Module 12 Penn Data Science Challenge

For this project, we were tasked with using PyMongo to access a database and collection of data. We used Jupyter Notebook to manipulate the database as well as pull information to analyze. 
To complete this project, I consulted with my group of cohort-mates Mia, Kiet, and Katie as well as received feedback from Professor Reed and TA Jake. I also used my Xpert Learning Assistant and ChatGPT resources.
